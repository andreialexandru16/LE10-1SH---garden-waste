# LE10-1SH---garden-waste


## Overview

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive redesign of the skip selection interface for WeWantWaste.co.uk, focusing on architectural robustness, scalability, and UX excellence while maintaining complete functional parity with the original implementation.

## Architectural Approach

The implementation follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain Layer**: Encapsulates business logic and data transformations
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles rendering and user interactions
- **Service Layer**: Manages API interactions and data fetching
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's Context API with reducers for predictable state changes

## Technical Stack Selection Rationale

### Core Technologies
- **React 18**: Leveraging the latest performance improvements and concurrent rendering
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid UI development without CSS bloat

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components
- Memoization of expensive calculations
- Virtualized lists for handling large datasets efficiently
- Asset optimization for improved loading times

### Accessibility Considerations
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigability
- Screen reader compatibility
- Semantic HTML structure

## Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
The system is built with reusable, composable components following the Atomic Design methodology:

- **Atoms**: Button, Card, Input, Icon
- **Molecules**: SkipOption, NavigationButton, PricingDisplay
- **Organisms**: SkipSelectionGrid, ProgressTracker
- **Templates**: PageLayout
- **Pages**: SkipSelectionPage

### State Management
The implementation uses a custom state management solution that combines React Context with reducers for a unidirectional data flow:

```typescript
interface SkipSelectionState {
  skips: Skip[];
  selectedSkipId: number | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

type Action = 
  | { type: 'FETCH_SKIPS_INIT' }
  | { type: 'FETCH_SKIPS_SUCCESS', payload: Skip[] }
  | { type: 'FETCH_SKIPS_ERROR', payload: string }
  | { type: 'SELECT_SKIP', payload: number }
  | { type: 'RESET_SELECTION' };
